Rise Above The Crowd Simile Widgets
===================================

This repo contains the html, json, css, and javascript used for creating an
Interactive Storytelling Exhibit for our Knight Foundation Funded Rise Above
The Crowd Campaign. It is based on the MIT Simile Project Exhibit example:
http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/examples/nobelists/nobelists.html

These widgets will be publicly available at http://rise.rit.edu after RIT's
Imagine Festival--where it will be debuted May 7th 2011.

This is my first attempt at using Exhibit, and thusfar, I am totally impressed.
The Simile Timeline widget inspired me to give Exhibit a try, and it does not
dissapoint. Shout out to the MIT Media Lab http://media.mit.edu for releasing
the source under a permissive license such as BSD, and writing such useful
tools.
