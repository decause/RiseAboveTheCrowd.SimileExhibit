      <div id="diff-inline-681"><p>Posted below are the meeting notes 
from the Sprint 5 Retrospective meeting. These meetings occur at the end
 of each sprint with the goal of improving the process. Two question are
 asked -- "What went well?" and "What could be improved?".</p>

<p>Everyone: Please let me know if I misrepresented you here.</p>

<h2>Red Bottle</h2>

<ul>
<li>Seppi: It's great to consult with Red Bottle, people who have professional Drupal experience.</li>
<li>Riordan: Yes. In the past we have tried researching stuff, but 
having someone who can say "Been there, done that, here's what you need 
to do." is very valuable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Estimation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Riordan: We need people to provide a more realistic estimation of 
how much work they can take on. Ariel has over-committed in the past, 
and John made the same mistake a week later.</li>
<li>John: [I didn't think to mention this at the meeting, but it is an important point. This is actually <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgch8BxSWw#t=02m25s">a very common problem</a> among Scrum teams. Teams learn to avoid this mistake only through experience.]</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Planning Meeting</h2>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Guy: I think the planning meeting went very well this week.</li>
<li>Me: What about it went well?</li>
<li>Guy: The timing was good. Everything was accomplished quickly (we 
even had 10 minutes to spare), but we still covered everything.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Being direct</h3>

<ul>
<li>Me: What do you think caused the timing to work out so well?</li>
<li>Guy: Everyone knew what needed to get done.</li>
<li>Riordan: Everyone realizes that the the deadline is looming.</li>
<li>Riordan: Also, John was very direct. He started the meeting off with
 "This is what needs to get done. We can't put off any development to 
week 9 -- we will only do testing that week. I won't budge on this."</li>
<li>Guy: Yes. You showed us where we were and what we needed to do.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"State of the state"</h3>

<ul>
<li>Me: At the beginning of the meeting, I gave an overview of all the 
remaining tickets. Did this work or not? I noticed that most people 
didn't seem interested in this.</li>
<li>Guy: I think it was good, but too fast. Also, you asked people "What
 do you want to do?". Instead, I think you should have framed the 
question as "What is the highest priority?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assigning tasks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mark: If someone doesn't have any tasks, give some to that person. 
We need stuff done. If someone is available, give that person something 
to do. I was in this position a few weeks ago -- I wasn't assigned 
anything, so I had nothing to do. I could have been working on the theme
 during that time.</li>
<li>Me: Guy, should I assign tickets to people who don't have any? Doesn't Scrum advise against this?</li>
<li>Guy: Yes. The success of the team depends on individual members 
being committed to success. If you assign tasks to people, they tend to 
be less committed to getting that task done.</li>
<li>Me: But I do think Mark is making an important point. Maybe we can 
strike a balance. If I notice someone is low on tasks, I can say "Hey 
Joe, you don't have a lot of stuff on your plate. What are you 
interested in working on?"</li>
<li>Guy: That seems like a good approach.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Food</h3>

<ul>
<li>Riordan: How has food affected the meetings? Has it had a positive or negative effect?</li>
<li>Me: I think pizza got people too excited. It gave them the energy to
 say "Well, we can do it this way!!". I really think that exhaustion was
 one of the reasons this last meeting was so successful. Everyone was 
tired, so cutting out the fluff to get to the core points was much more 
easy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"To be done..."</h3>

<ul>
<li>Me: While we all seem to like the "To be done..." criteria, I think 
it is too time consuming to write them out during the meetings. Matt and
 Ben mentioned their frustration with this. Filling these out before the
 meetings would be very helpful, I think.</li>
<li>Riordan: Yes. Some things will change slightly during the meeting, 
but we will have about 80% understanding of what needs to be done before
 the meeting.</li>
<li>Me: Agreed. Professor Riordan, can you fill these out before these meetings?</li>
<li>Riordan: I have a tight schedule, but I can get some work in. Since 
you're usually in at about 12, maybe you can review / amend them at that
 time.</li>
<li>Me: That makes sense. I tend to be more conservative, so maybe this 
would be a good job for me. "Don't forget to about this aspect of that 
feature!"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Misc</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mark: John often defaults back to "I'll take the ticket" if no one 
else is interested. Don't let that happen. Let other people take 
responsibility for the work.</li>
<li>Me: Agreed. I'll do that.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Daily Status Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Riordan: Participation is low.</li>
<li>Guy: Yes, but it is better than the last time John tried it.</li>
<li>Guy: Dustin asked me "If I don't do anything, should I still write 
something up?" I told him that he should -- the point is not to make 
people feel guilty about not doing enough work, the point is to get an 
understanding of where everyone is.</li>
<li>Me: Funny, Jackie asked me the same question. I had essentially the same answer.</li>
<li>Me: Do you think it is too time-consuming for people to fill these out?</li>
<li>Guy: I think the length is fine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Burnout</h2>

<ul>
<li>For me, the most major problem this week was burnout and lack of 
motivation. I had enough time to improve the contribution form, but I 
was just too burned out to do much. I barely had enough energy to think.</li>
<li>Guy: You know why that is, right?</li>
<li>Me: No...</li>
<li>Guy: Scrum advocates having a short break between sprints. Some 
companies have, for example, three week sprints. They sprint for three 
weeks and have a retrospective meeting at the end. They then spend about
 a week working on other projects before starting the next sprint.</li>
<li>Riordan: In the hyper-compressed development we are doing now, the 
time to relax is the weekend. We need to make sure everyone uses it 
effectively.</li>
<li>Guy: John, have you been working on the weekends?</li>
<li>Me: Not much, but sometimes.</li>
<li>Riordan: You shouldn't. You need to relax.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ben / Design</h2>

<ul>
<li>Guy: Ben's design mockups were amazing. Seeing tangible stuff like that is great.</li>
<li>Me: Do you think that fits into the "user story"-driven development that you advocate?</li>
<li>Guy: <strong>Yes!</strong> That's essentially what it was. "To post a story, the user goes here", etc.</li>
<li>Me: I totally agree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>"Done"</h2>

<ul>
<li>Riordan: I think the deadlines have been ending soft. We never fully
 meet out deadlines, and instead end in a state of 
almost-done-but-continuing-next-week.</li>
<li>Me: I've been thinking about this. Last year, I took a much more 
strict approach to "done". If we needed to finish, say, user 
registration at the end of Sprint 1, I would ensure that everything 
regarding registration was completely finished by that point. I would 
stay up until 4am to make sure that happened. This worked to a degree, 
but it also increased stress dramatically.</li>
<li>Guy: I think the "To be done..." criteria work well here, since 
these are minimum requirements for completion. If something doesn't meet
 these criteria, the whole task should be marked as incomplete and moved
 to the next sprint.</li>
<li>Riordan: If we had more time, I think we would have better time estimates by now and this would be sort of a non-issue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How sprints end</h2>

<ul>
<li>Guy: What I want to know is how sprints end. I really have no idea, 
and I don't think anyone else really knows either. I don't know what 
actual deployment process I need to keep in mind and live up to.</li>
<li>Me: That makes sense. I think people will be more likely to live up 
to their tasks if they actually picture what will happen at the end.</li>
<li>Guy: Yes. In the future, just say "On Friday, I will take your code and move it here."</li>
